    ''',
    
    'pixel size equals digit scaling factor':
    '''
    Defines the scaling factor to use when scaling a pixel to its corresponding digit. Larger values give larger pixels.
    ''',
    
    'scale size over time':
    '''
    Increses the scaling factor of pixels over time. Overrides 'Pixel size equals digit' and 'Pixel size equals digit scaling factor'.

    '''
    Determines the thickness of each line.
    ''',
        
    'wait until done':
    '''
    Updates the canvas only after the process has finished. This speeds up processing times.
    ''',

    'frame skip interval':
    '''
    Determines how many frames will pass between canvas updates. This can speed up processing times whilst allowing the user to see the drawing process.

    'move distance':
    '''
    Determines how far the turtle will move at each step.
    ''',

    'output filename':
    '''
    Names the output file for the screenshot. Don't add the extension to the name. Files are saved as PNGs.
    ''',

    'digit is colour':
    '''
    Each pen stroke/pixel will correspond to the digit it represents.
    ''',
