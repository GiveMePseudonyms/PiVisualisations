# PiVisualisations

A project I created in August 2022 to visualise millions of digits of Pi. This is a work in progress!

Todo:

    Major entry point overhaul:
        Allow the user to select a visualiser and see a preview image of it as well as choose the settings they want to use
            Just pass them in as commands and use tkinter to get them from the user. This will require checking for empty fields.
    General overhaul to allow the user to choose to save a screenshot of the canvas they create.
    General bugfixes incl image quality, window sizes etc.
